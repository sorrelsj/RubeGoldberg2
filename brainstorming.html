    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
    <p>The brainstorming process laid the foundation for the project by identifying key requirements, engineering specifications, and possible systems to implement. The goal was to create a functional, efficient, and innovative component for the Rube Goldberg machine. A stakeholder analysis was done to better understand the requirements of the project, which will lead to further the direction of the design. Not a whole lot is decided at this stage, but ideas are starting to formulate.</p>

    <h4>Key Stakeholders</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Instructor, Input/Output Team Members, Other Classmates</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Audience, Material Supplier, Legal Advisor</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Academic Institution, Inspector</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Engineering Specifications</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Works With Surrounding Parts:</strong> Tolerances of 1/1000 to 1/10 inch for fitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Not Difficult to Actuate:</strong> Actuation force between 5-40 Newtons.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Cycle:</strong> Process duration between 5-30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Assemble:</strong> A simple design with 3-4 pieces maximum.</li>
        <li><strong>Small in Size:</strong> Compact dimensions to minimize delays.</li>
        <li><strong>Unibody Preferred:</strong> Simplifies assembly and reduces material costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe to Use:</strong> Safety factor greater than 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Light in Weight:</strong> Optimized for easy handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Able to Operate at Livable Temperatures:</strong> Tolerant to 40°F - 110°F.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Benchmarking</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ball & Track System:</strong> A simple gravity-powered system with plastic or metal tracks, though prone to imbalances and jams.</li>
        <li><strong>Domino Chain Reaction:</strong> A fragile, gravity-driven system requiring precise setup and interaction with surrounding parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Waterwheel System:</strong> A rotating mechanism powered by water flow, offering rotational force for other mechanisms. It requires careful water flow management.</li>
    </ul>
