        <h3>Function Process Example</h3>
        <div class="scroll-box">
            <p>I am the electrical signal flow in an electric guitar. My journey begins at the pluck of one my six strings and ends as soundwaves exiting an amplifier. Through my journey I interact with various components, each one modifying my form into something more pleasing to the human ear.</p>
            <p>The foundational input for my journey lies in the mechanical energy formed from the guitarist plucking away at the strings. This creates vibrations that oscillate at different frequencies according to finger placement and string choice.</p>
            <p>I am then induced through the magnetic field of the guitar's pickups, turning into an electrical current. You could say it "picked-up" my energy from the strings vibrations and transformed me into an electrical signal. Pretty clever, and there are different types of pick-ups, but they are typically humbucker pickups.</p>
            <p>After being turned into an electrical signal, I go through tonal control circuitry so the guitarist can shape my sound (or body? It is hard to keep track of silly human semantics) with light filtering, usually a low pass, to get a warmer tone. They are able to do so by turning a simple mechanical knob on the face of their instrument.</p>
            <p>Now that I have been shaped into a more pleasing tone, I can go through the volume control circuitry to amplify my signal. This first stage of volume control is important because it allows the guitarist to control volume on the fly, without having to mess with any other piece of equipment.</p>
            <p>The only thing left for the instrument to do is transfer me into a medium that I can easily pass through, such as through an output jack and into an electrical cord. Hopefully a good electrical cord is being used, because the integrity of my signal can be lost if I am not handled with care. I am pretty sure my signal can be completely lost if one the cables aren't plugged in all the way, so hopefully the guitarist pushing me along my journey double-checked everything as well.</p>
            <p>Some guitarists choose to let me flow through a variety of effect pedals at this stage of the journey. Honestly, I don't mind it too much. Some of the effect pedals can do some really interesting things to my final form - I have even heard of some humans becoming famous through their use of the "wah-wah" pedal (whatever that is). It makes me excited that humans love what I do that much.</p>
            <p>Alright, we are at the last stage of the game now. Time for me to be amplified and put through a speaker, so I can finally turn into what the musician intended from the start. Once my electrical signal is amplified a final time, it is put through a series of tiny components to turn my body into audio waves. I can now fill the air with music and reminisce on the long journey I have taken and consider the ones to come.</p>

        <h3>List of Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Actuate switch (introduce force to mechanism).</li>
            <li>Control flow (regulate how much water is released and how quickly).</li>
            <li>Guide water (direct water to the water wheel).</li>
            <li>Spin wheel (transform energy from water into rotational energy).</li>
            <li>Transfer motion (transfer rotational energy from wheel to gear).</li>
            <li>Rotate gear (rotational motion is transferred from first gear to the second gear).</li>
            <li>Spin hammer (the second gear spins, spinning the hammer that is connected).</li>
            <li>Smash object (the hammer swings down and strikes the next part of the machine).</li>
            <li>Store energy (potential energy is conserved by the hammer until released).</li>
            <li>Support structure (make sure the machine is rigid).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Issue</h3>
        <p>Gears weigh too much. Material choice could be taken into consideration. Could possibly put gears before the water wheel. This presents an interesting engineering challenge.</p>
